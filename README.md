# tictacktoe


This is a simple tic tac toe game you can play with your friends, on the desktop or even on the go.


## User Stories. 
I Wrote some simple user stories.

I want to be able to track whos turn it is.
I want to be able to restart the game. 
I want to be able to have way to keep score across games.
I want to be able to limit the time each player has to make a move. 
I want to be able to send my score to my friends on social media.


## Wireframes: I made some primitive wireframes on pen and paper. 

Screenshots of these pieces of papers. 

I wanted a main page where the user can select wether to play vs each other or vs a computer AI. In the end i did not have time to implement the AI logic so for now you are limited to playing by yourself or with a friend. 

If i had more time then some difficulty levels for the AI and so forth.

## UX process.

I used a simple container for the game, with a 3x3 grid. The Logic of game is simple. 


 ## Testing. 

 I have tested the game and it works as intended, no apparent bugs where found. 

 Added a Modal for contacts but it broke. Works if you use tab to select fields but you cannot click them. didnt have time to fix it.

 ## Algorith/Game logic. 

 Its a big function that handles all the logic, sets the game state etc. I made some comments in the scripts.


### Inspiration

These three examples i took inspiration from. Credits to them.
